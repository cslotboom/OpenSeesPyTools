# OpenSeesPyTools
This library provides data processing tool and animation tools for opensees. 
The package is pip-installable with the command "pip install openseespytools".

Fucntions are broken into three areas - data processing, plotting XY response curves, and understanding/visualizing openseesPy models.

Currently the model plotting functions are out of date. I have been updating the OpenSees base repository instead!
