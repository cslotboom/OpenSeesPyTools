# OpenSeesPyTools
This library provides data processing tool and animation tools for opensees. 
The package is pip-installable with the command "pip install openseespytools".

Fucntions are broken into three areas - data processing, plotting XY response curves, and understanding/visualizing openseesPy models.

The earthquake animation may run slowly for larger models - I haven't stressed tested it much.
Eventually my goal is to switch away from using a matplotlib back end into something like OpenGL.
